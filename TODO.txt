Get away from the busy and electronic driven world to relax at The Round House.
Located 45 minutes by boat from Rio Dulce and 30 minutes from Livingston, The Round House the perfect place for those looking to grab a beer and swim in the river.
Reconnect with nature by hiking through the lush jungle or kayak down the beauty Rio Dulce.
Observe animals in their natural habitat in bird and Manti watching tours, or just grab a cocktail and get a new tan! The Round House offers excellent food, top notch staff, and a place to meet new people, all at
an affordable rate. Come visit us!


The Round House is specially located in an area where wild Manti's live. With some luck and patience one can see them popping up for air.
There is one Manti in particular, we've named Captain Hook, that likes to sleep right in front of the Round House.
